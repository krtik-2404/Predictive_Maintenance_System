## Predictive Maintenance System

Predictive maintenance solution using NASA CMAPSS turbofan engine dataset to forecast Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and prevent equipment failures through data-driven insights.

## Key Features
- Multi-model ensemble approach for robust RUL prediction
- Time-series feature engineering and preprocessing pipeline
- Comprehensive model evaluation with cross-validation metrics
- Scalable architecture for industrial deployment

## Tech Stack
```
• Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
• LSTM, Transformer, XGBoost ensemble models
• SHAP explainability for model interpretability
• Jupyter Notebooks | GitHub Actions CI/CD
```

## Results
Achieved competitive RUL prediction accuracy on NASA benchmark dataset with detailed performance analysis across multiple engine failure scenarios.

##  Quick Start
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd predictive-maintenance
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
